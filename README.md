## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- Atomic Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In Tailwind CSS, you can set the width, maximum width, and minimum width of an element using utility classes.

```tsx
<div class="w-full max-w-[22rem] min-w-[18rem]">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>

/*
  - w-full sets the width to 100%.
  - max-w-[22rem] sets the maximum width to 22rem.
  - min-w-[18rem] sets the minimum width to 18rem.

*/
```

### Continued development

I need to improve with Tailwind and Atomic Design.
